										<h2 class="major">Erick Peirson, PhD</h2>
										<p>Erick Peirson is an historian of science and software engineer working at Arizona State University. He spent his youth in Washington where he developed his passion for biology and learnt how to drive boats. This let him to his first career as a boat captain. After moving to Arizona to pursue a PhD on the historical and conceptual foundations of 20th-century ecology and evolutionary theory, Erick deepened his interest in software development and computational research systems. He became a skilled Python software engineer and founded together with Julia Damerow A Place Called Up Consulting, a consulting company that works with academic units, teams, and individual scholars to advance excellence in digital humanities research, training, and outreach.</p>
										<p>In his free time, Erick enjoys hiking, running, and spending time outdoors with his dogs. His ideal place to live has mountains, lakes, and trees with temperatures below 80 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity above 40%. While there is a great story behind how Erick got his name, make sure to spell his name correctly as this might be one of the biggest annoyances in his life.
